# Slim Framework 4 Starter Template

This is a basic starter template for Slim Framework 4 that provides a minimal structure for building web applications. It includes pre-built authentication for normal users and admins, as well as a basic 404 error handling mechanism. This template is designed to serve as a foundation for larger projects, not as a complete ready-to-use application.

- PHP 7.4 or later
